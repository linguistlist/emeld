Audiamus instantiates links between texts and media, based on timecodes derived from processing in Transcriber or similar  programs. The need for a special tool arose in the absence of a simple method to work interactively with digitised ethnographic field tapes via their transcripts. It is designed with the key principles of reusability of and accessibility to the data, with the basic premise that every example quoted in my thesis should be provenanced to an archival  source if possible. 

With Audiamus the user can click on any sentence or chunk in the corpus and hear it or view the video. Version 2.3 adds the ability to repeat the played chunk and to slow down the player.

BITC is a system for collecting interlinear texts and is especially designed for group collaboration. BITC is installed on a network server, and users access BITC through a web browser. This is ideal for group work, since, once the server is set up, practically anyone can get involved with the project without having to install special software. Also, everyone benefits from the texts collected by everyone else on the project because all work contributes to a shared dictionary. Using the Internet potentially enables geographically-dispersed researchers to collaborate with each other, too! Currently, BITC is ALPHA software, which means it is not for the faint-of-heart, mainly because installation may be difficult.

ELAN (EUDICO Linguistic Annotator) is a multimedia annotation tool developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. ELAN supports linguistic resources that consist of media tracks and separate annotation layers that contain linguistically relevant descriptions of events that occur within the media tracks. The media signal, audio and/or video, is displayed together with annotations. Those annotations can be exactly aligned with media time. Furthermore, ELAN allows for an unlimited numbers of annotation tiers to be defined by the user. This means that users can compose their own tier setup, including the definition of new annotation layer types.

## Comments

### Rating: 4 Submitted: 2005-05-02 Updated: 2006-06-05
#### Pros
These comments are on version 2.4, which is considerably improved over previous versions. The best aspect of ELAN is that it produces an archival XML file, which can then be used not only for archiving purposes, but also for creating language products. Elan also allows customization of tier types and dependencies, is fully Unicode-compliant, and has a logical (though not very beautiful) interface. Elan is fully Macintosh compatible.
#### Cons
Learning to use Elan takes a bit of time and effort at the beginning: it takes a while to understand exactly what the various tier types stand for. Also, this is not the best software to use if you are in the process of analyzing texts, as it is not easy or often even possible to go back in and change tier definitions or to nudge the time codes a little to the right or the left. I would recommend this software for those who already have analyzed texts and want an XML file.
### Rating: 4 Submitted: 2006-02-27 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
Allows textual time-aligned annotation of audio and video data (up to four media streams) on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux, using any file format supported by the operating system.  Any number of lines of annotations may be defined, with different styles of alignment, and the option of using a small, user-determined class of annotations when appropriate.  Permits annotation of long recordings (an hour or more).  

Allows either Unicode or legacy data; annotation files are XML.  Can import and export data from other annotation formats, including Shoebox.
#### Cons
Interface is a compromise between three different operating systems and is likely to leave users from all three feeling that it is foreign.  Takes some time to learn how to use it well, although the manuals are gradually getting more helpful.  

The XML format of the annotation files is fragile; direct modification by a text editor must be done carefully, as some things that should be legal XML are not accepted by ELAN.

A tool for learning about the coverage of large generation grammars; aimed currently at grammars written in the systemic-functional style; The operation of the tool is essentially as a coder: you, as the user, should select some sentence, or other grammatical unit, and attempt to `code' that unit using the terms of a grammar. The tool leads you through the grammar presenting the options that are available (&  you can ask for examples exhibiting the relevant grammatical choices); it also tells you the syntagmatic consequences of those choices (i.e., what structure is generated). If your coding is correct, then it should be possible to relate the structure you have generated to the original target unit. The Explorer differs from coding, or text annotation/markup, in that it provides access to the structural consequences of coding. This provides a natural check to the accuracy of any coding carried out. The Explorer also differs from an annotated corpus of examples, in that the examples it shows are all generated with the grammar that it contains.

Graphite is a project under development within SIL’s Non-Roman Script Initiative and Language Software Development groups to provide rendering capabilities for complex non-Roman writing systems. (Work began in 1997 under the code name WinRend.) The original goal was a system for the Windows platform; a port to Linux is currently underway. Graphite can be used to create “smart fonts” capable of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors. With respect to the Text Encoding Model, Graphite handles the "Rendering" aspect of writing system implementation.

# HIAT and HIAT-DOS

According to Thomas Schmidt,

"Clarification: HIAT (Halbinterpretative Arbeitstranskriptionen - „semi-interpretative working transcriptions“) is the name of a transcription convention. It is not the name of a software tool, but there are several tools that were designed with transcription according to HIAT in mind. HIAT-DOS is one of these tools, the others are syncWriter and the EXMARaLDA Partitur-Editor. The latter offers an import filter for transforming HIAT-DOS data to XML (this will still require manual post-editing, though).

HIAT-DOS is an MS-DOS application, i.e. it will run on Windows, but without making use of the operating system's graphical user interface. It will not run on any other operating system. The main idea of the tool is to support the user in creating transcriptions in musical score notation, i.e. transcriptions where the contributions of different speakers are arranged on separate tiers making possible an intuitive  representation of simultaneous or overlapping speech events. Creating and editing such muscial score transcripts in standard text processing software can be tedious because changes, deletions and insertions often make necessary a complete re-arrangement of the whole system wrt line-wrapping etc. HIAT-DOS is meant to help in that task. A transcript that has been created in HIAT-DOS can be exported to RTF or HTML for further editing in a text processing software, printout, web display etc."

Annotating video sequences with MPEG-7 metadata. Each shot in the video sequence can be annotated with static scene descriptions, key object descriptions, event descriptions, and other lexicon sets. The annotated descriptions are associated with each video shot and are put out and stored as MPEG-7 descriptions in an XML file. IBM MPEG-7 Annotation Tool can also open MPEG-7 files in order to display the annotations for the corresponding video sequence. IBM MPEG-7 Annotation Tool also allows customized lexicons to be created, saved, downloaded, and updated. IBM MPEG-7 Annotation Tool takes an MPEG video sequence as the required input source. The tool also requires a corresponding shot segmentation file, where the video sequence input is segmented into smaller units called video shots by detecting the scene cuts, dissolutions, and fadings. This shot file can be loaded into the tool from other sources or generated when the video input is first opened. After IBM MPEG-7 Annotation Tool performs shot detection on a video, the shot file can be saved in MPEG-7 schema for later use. As an alternative, the shot file can also be generated by the IBM CueVideo Shot Detection Tool Kit.

The Indiana Dictionary Database (IDD) is an NSF-Sponsored Project.

A multimedia dictionary database program in Microsoft Visual FoxPro that has been created specifically for compiling dictionaries of American Indian languages. The program, now in its final stages of development, is designed to support standard textual linguistic material as well as sound data, graphical images, and video clips.

Features of the program include:

    1) It structures data in one-to-many relationships, in contrast to the standard flat-file format of most databases used by linguists.
       
    2) It provides sound recordings. This innovative feature allows sound recordings of native speakers pronouncing entry forms as well as grammatical forms and examples of words in phrases and sentences. The recordings supplement the written record by providing a comprehensive oral record of the lexicon as well.
       
    3) It allows graphical images and video clips. This feature provides for illustrations of entries that are critical for clarifying cultural objects and actions for which there are no standard English translations.
       
    4) It is designed so that the user can export the database to any one of a number of specially formatted output files, enabling the user to provide the data in HTML/world-wide-web format, WordPerfect format, or standard ASCII format. Thus the dictionary database can be readily published both as a professionally formatted printed version and as a state-of-the-art professionally formatted electronic version.

## Comments

### Rating: 1 Submitted: 2006-02-27 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
Provided the ability (in the early 1990s) to define an annotation format consisting of up to 15 aligned lines for interlinear text.  Ran much faster than Shoebox for DOS, which was significant at the time when verifying previously-glossed text, but now (in 2006) irrelevant because of faster computers and its obsolescence.  When first released, I would have ranked it 4, but now it should no longer be used.
#### Cons
Obsolete, due to its operating system (MS-DOS, not Windows), use of binary files in proprietary format for the lexical glossing database, an interface that forces sequential processing of texts, and lack of Unicode support.  A great tool when it was released, but now left to rest in peace.

Interlinear Text Formatter

## Comments

### Rating: 3 Submitted: 2006-02-27 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
A formatting package, built on TeX, that provides a variety of output layouts for interlinear text.  Input texts are in SIL standard format (e.g. Shoebox).  Flexible and sophisticated in its formatting capabilities.
#### Cons
Originally released in the 1990s; I have no idea how well it would work with TeX systems now (2006).  I formatted a couple dozen interlinear texts with it at one time and found that it required quite a bit of knowledge of TeX.  If it still worked, it could still be useful if one knew TeX, but that is a formidable step that would probably discourage most users.

IT (pronounced "eye-tee") is a set of software tools for developing a corpus of annotated interlinear texts. IT performs two main tasks: (1) it maintains the vertical alignment of the interlinear annotations, and (2) it stores all word and morpheme annotations in a lexical database thus enabling semi-automatic glossing. IT supports up to 14 levels of aligning text annotations and up to 8 different freeform (nonaligning) annotations. The interlinear text file produced by IT is a plain ASCII text file that is accessible to other text-processing software.

## Comments

#### Pros
Excel is a well known spreadsheet program from Microsoft. As with all spreadsheet programs they have many uses, and it could be used for managinging a lexicon.
One possible advantage is that it may be already installed as it is a part of MS Office. The rating here isn't a reflection of the quality of Excel, just that it is unlikely to be the best tool for this job.
#### Cons
It is expensive.

OpenOffice Calc would be a free alternative, but that is also a spreadsheet program, and neither are

designed for managing lexical data.

To use these you would have to create and manage all the data structure yourself.



There are limits to the number of records that could be added (about 65000) so you would either need to split larger lexicons. There are also limits on the number of fields that can be used to describe each lexeme, though these are less likely to be a limiting factor.

## Comments

### Rating: 1 Submitted: 2006-02-27 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
General-purpose programmable text editor for manipulating non-Unicode text files.  Ingenious and very useful at the time it was created (1980s); it was a workhorse for me.
#### Cons
Originally written for computers with very limited capabilities (e.g. as little as 32Kb of memory).  As a result, is cryptic and difficult to use.  MUCH better tools exist now (2006).

Hasan 1984; Halliday & Hasan 1985). Windows, Macintosh, UNIX and LINUX operating systems (requires the pre-installation of Tcl/Tk, a scripting language engine). The Tool consists of four interfaces: Text Segmentation: for marking the boundaries between text segments; Text Structuring: for marking the structural relations between these segments; Relation Editor: for maintaining the set of discourse relations, and schemas. Statistics: for deriving simple descriptive statistics based on your analysis.

Shoebox is a computer program that helps field linguists and anthropologists integrate various kinds of text data: lexical, cultural, grammatical, etc. It has flexible options for sorting, selecting, and displaying data. It is especially useful for helping researchers build a dictionary as they use it to analyze and interlinearize text. The name Shoebox recalls the use of shoe boxes to hold note cards on which definitions of words were written in the days before researchers could use computers in the field.

SignStream is a database tool for analysis of linguistic data captured on video. Although SignStream is being designed specifically for working with data from American Sign Language, the tool may be applied to any kind of language data captured on video. In particular, SignStream would be suited to the study of other signed languages as well as to studies that include the gestural component of spoken languages. SignStream provides a single environment for manipulating digital video and linking specific frame sequences to simultaneously occurring linguistic events encoded in a fine-grained multi-level transcription. Items from different fields are vertically aligned to reflect their temporal relations. Not only does SignStream greatly simplify the transcription process and increase the accuracy of transcriptions (by virtue of the link of linguistic events with video frames), but it enhances the researcher's ability to perform linguistic analyses of various kinds. By providing sophisticated search capabilities, SignStream affords instant access to data. In addition, multiple utterances can be open at the same time, permitting side-by-side comparison of data.

(This comment applies only to IPAHelp.)
IPAHelp allows self-training in IPA via clickable IPA chart. It can be downloaded, installed and used offline, and includes a few interactive IPA 'quizzes'.
#### Cons
(This comment applies only to IPAHelp.)

Listening to isolated segments via desktop speakers (and even via headphones), it is very difficult to perceive distinctions. The IPAHelp would be more useful with an extensive list of minimal pairs.

Systemic Coder is a tool that facilitates the linguistic coding of corpus material, through the prompting of the user for relevant categories. Linguistic features are organised in terms of a systemic network -- an inheritance hierarchy-- to reduce the amount of coding effort. You first define your feature hierarchy, and then prompted to code the segements of the text according to the hierarchy. These codings can then be statistically analysed, either using the built-in comparative statistics programs, or by exporting the codings in a form readable by statistical packages.

Toolbox is a data management and analysis tool for field linguists. It is especially useful for maintaining lexical data, and for parsing and interlinearizing text, but it can be used to manage virtually any kind of data.

Differences between Shoebox 5 and Toolbox

Toolbox has a number of enhancements over Shoebox. Most of these will not affect you if you use Toolbox on a Shoebox project. But a few of them may cause slightly different behaviour, hopefully better in most cases.

* Unicode has been enabled using UTF-8. To make Keyman work with Unicode, see the topics "Keyman" and "Using Unicode" in the on-line help. Note: Recent versions of Consistent Changes have the "u" command which can be used for converting data to Unicode.

[The Unicode support is not complete, in particular it does not support Chinese characters; it uses the Windows renderer, hence does not support special use area characters; you must use Keyman for data entry; and right-to-left scripts do not work in interlinear text.]

* Interlinear Verify is available through Tools, Spelling and Interlinear Check. This will verify that all interlinear annotations correspond to entries in the lexicons.

[Verification means that when you re-parse the text, it will not overwrite your choice of parses where there is ambiguity.]

* External jump: Paratext and CarlaStudio have commands that ask Toolbox to jump. Toolbox searches the indexes of all views, and jumps to any that match. This can cause multiple views to all jump at once.

* The same multiple window Jump can be used inside Toolbox. If no Jump Path is set for a particular marker, then jumping from that field causes all available views that are sorted by the correct language to jump.

* Parallel movement: If two (or more) windows are sorted by the same language and the second is a Jump Target, the second will move from record to record in parallel with the first.

* Toolbox now uses a dot instead of a space in Number and Renumber text. This makes a reference that can be jumped to with right click. This greatly enhances the usefulness of Word List and Concordance.
    * Added Project, Auto Save option.
    * File Save toolbar button saves all.
    * Added Tools, Adapt All to adapt whole (or rest of) file.
    * Added Edit, Return from Jump. This command returns to last window jumped from. It also performs the interlinearize command if returning from dictionary to interlinear text. (Note: Return from Jump returns to the window, not the record. If you jump to elsewhere in the same window, Return from Jump will not do anything.)
    * Set Wrap Margin sets the margin for all open files of the current database type.
    * Improved spacing of interlinear text on screen.
    * Ambiguity box is enlarged.
    * Made it easier to transfer projects from one machine to another.
    * Dialog boxes don't split across multiple monitors.
    * Mouse wheel scrolling works.
    * Added display of sort CC table name in Language Encoding Options.
    * Made root guess work with insert into lexicon.
    * Add new interlinear process at top of list if the first process was selected.
    * Enlarged edit windows in dialog boxes and use full size language font in them.
    * Allow no morph break chars for languages with no word break spaces.
    * Made root guess try compound roots, for languages with no word spaces.
    * Made tab key move to next field, shift tab to previous.
    * Made text numbering do 4 digit numbers if desired.
    * Don't ask user for ambiguity selection in lookup of morpheme guesses from a parse failure.

[XML export is supported, BUT there is no verification of correctness.]

### Rating: 2 Submitted: 2005-04-17 Updated: 2005-04-28
#### Pros
Very flexible database structure,
interlinearisation functions,
limited unicode compliance, 
export to multiple formats,
can add sounds and graphics for export to Lexique or Word
#### Cons
RANDOM CRASHES! This has always been a problem with versions of shoebox (and now toolboox). Toolbox is much less stable than the latest Shoebox release (I'm using the release of Nov 2004). Jumping records from browse view will crash the program, as will some interlinearisation, and sometimes it just gives up. And the unicode functionality is limited to data entry, so defining filters, sort orders and the like, as using unicode characters in menus, doesn't work. This just leads to inconsistent data entry.

I've been using Shoebox since 1996 and am extremely unimpressed with toolbox. The extra features from shoebox are useless if the program cannot be counted on to run reliably.
### Rating: 4 Submitted: 2005-10-13 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
Very powerful and flexible, able to jump between lexicon and texts (requires setting up jump paths).
#### Cons
Because it requires significant skill in setting up it is easy to make errors in the setting up process. However once set up Toolbox is a very powerful interlineariser.
### Rating: 5 Submitted: 2005-12-29 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
+ Functions of Shoebox but with Unicode support 
+ Better configuration (different export processes, consistent changes processes may be chained)
+ XML export
Having used the current version 1.4 of Toolbox in day to day use the software has proved to be stable in the projects I am involved in.
### Rating: 4 Submitted: 2006-02-27 Updated: 2006-06-06
#### Pros
Version 1.4 has corrected many of the problems noted by Claire Bowern in her comments on version 1.2.  Stability is greatly improved.  Some new features include ability to hide fields that are not of interest and ability to "play" any file supported by the operating system, by launching the application that normally handles that file, including video and still images.  Overall, Toolbox 1.4 seems to me to be clearly superior to Shoebox 5.0.
#### Cons
Dialogue boxes that allow input of Unicode data still behave in non-standard and clumsy ways, in an early attempt to retain compatibility with Windows 9x operating systems.  A new version is in preparation that will correct this problem and which will also run on Macintosh computers.

From the web page (my comments in []):
Toolbox is built on Shoebox 5, and is upward compatible with Shoebox. It adds Unicode support, automatic keyboard switching with Keyman 5 and 6, and verification of interlinear text. 
[Verification means that when you re-parse the text, it will not overwrite your choice of parses where there is ambiguity.  The Unicode support is not complete, in particular it does not support Chinese characters; it uses the Windows renderer, hence does not support special use area characters; you must use Keyman for data entry; and right-to-left scripts do not work in interlinear text.
XML export is supported, BUT there is no verification of correctness.

According to Thomas Schmidt,

"Transana is a tool for managing, transcribing and analyzing digital audio and video recordings. It runs on Windows and Macintosh platforms. It can handle video files in MPEG and AVI formats (no support for MOV files) and audio files in MP3, WAV, AU and SND formats. The main idea of the tool is to support the user in organizing long video files into smaller units of analysis, in assigning keywords to such units and in producing transcripts that can be (optionally) time-aligned with the recordings. The former two of these functionalities are, to my knowledge, not provided by any other transcription tool to the same extent. The latter functionality is comparable, for instance, to what the CLAN tool offers. The developers are David Woods and Chris Fassnacht from the University of Wisconsin. Transana is open source software, and its development is ongoing. The tool comes in a single-user and a multiple-user version. I tested version 2.10 of the single-user version."

Transcriber is a tool for assisting the manual annotation of speech signals. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface for segmenting long duration speech recordings, transcribing them, and labeling speech turns, topic changes and acoustic conditions. It is more specifically designed for the annotation of broadcast news recordings, for creating corpora used in the development of automatic broadcast news transcription systems, but its features might be found useful in other areas of speech research.  

Version 1.5.0 has a number of new features; a description of these can be found at :

Easy to install and use. If you don't need Unicode then it is great.
#### Cons
Unicode support is strange. There is support for Unicode if you do al the transcription in one session, but if you save the session and return, the Unicode is lost.

Ukelele is a Unicode Keyboard Layout Editor for Mac OS X versions 10.2 and later. Ukelele aims to simplify keyboard layout editing by providing a graphical interface to .keylayout files, where the desired characters can simply be dragged onto keys as needed. (The Character Palette, available in the Input menu if it has been enabled in System Preferences, is a great place to find the characters.) In addition to simple assignment of single character codes to keys, Ukelele can assign multiple-character strings and can create "dead keys", where a keystroke sets a new state that modifies the output of the following keystroke.

VoiceWalker 2.0 is basically a glorified digital tape deck. Yet it has the added benefit of being able to systematically step (or "walk") through a recording, repeating short segments for a specified number of repetitions, then moving on to the next segment. The segments overlap, so that the transcriber does not become disoriented. Works with WAV files, Windows AVI files and Quicktime MOV files. Windows 95/98. This version has been written in Visual Basic.

## Comments

### Rating: 5 Submitted: 2006-06-20 Updated: 2006-06-23
#### Pros
Wavesurfer
A small, easy to use tool for editing and looking at wav files. It has a simple interface and allows users to open wav files in different configurations, such as IPA transcription, Speech analysis, Waveform, Spectrogram and others. At the time of trial, some of these configurations, such as 'Speech analysis', show the form, however, the Spectrogram would not load. There was also an error in loading a stereo wav file ('Error: 'pitch only works with Mono sounds'). WaveSurfer allows users to add a level of annotation beneath the wav form that is time aligned with the text. WaveSurfers best quality seems to be it's easy-to-use interface for playing small wave forms. It's to easy edit, transcribe and save files.
#### Cons
The relationship between WaveSurfer and Snack (from the Wavesurfer FAQ):

WaveSurfer is built using the Snack toolkit and the Tcl/Tk language. Snack provides all low level functionality while WaveSurfer is the application which also contains a library of high-level visualization components. Snack is only of interest for advanced user and developers. users of the binary Windows/Linux releases need never know or worry about Snack or Tcl/Tk.
### Rating: 5 Submitted: 2007-03-28 Updated: 2007-03-28
#### Pros
For the purposes of segmentation and labelling of speech, WaveSurfer is "son of xlabel", using some of the same software as the old ESPS package. It has a very clear interface, with vertical cursor lines that are time-aligned across all windows and can be dragged rather than just clicked (unlike Praat, which is not as good for manual labelling for this reason).
#### Cons
It has no facility for scripting, unlike Praat. But otherwise I can't think of any disadvantages, and for manual segmentation/labelling I have found WaveSurfer the best tool to use.

Wordcorr, a new tool for research and teaching in comparative linguistics, is now in production release 2.0 for Windows 98/2000/XP. It can be downloaded free from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wordcorr. The University of Hawai`i at Mānoa's Linguistics department, SIL International, and DataHouse Inc. of Honolulu, collaborated to produce Wordcorr under a grant from the National Science Foundation's Information Technology Research initiative and the Linguistics Program. Wordcorr automates the tedious and risky process of tabulating and managing the sound correspondences used in working out the historical development of natural languages. Data can be input from the keyboard and edited in full Unicode, or imported from other Wordcorr users, spreadsheets, WordSurv, and Palmsurv; they are backed up by exporting the internal Wordcorr database including analyses in zipped XML files that facilitate file sharing, for example by research teams or in linguistics classes. It gives access to all the data, all the time. A more detailed overview will be available soon on http://www.wordcorr.org. Investigators of endangered languages whose classification is still uncertain will profit from Wordcorr's rapidity and flexibility, allowing alternate hypotheses to be tested simultaneously.

As in music, when transcribing it's important not to miss your entry. The idea is quite simple: The transcriptions of events (e.g. speaking) taking place synchronously at the same time are aligned to the same horizontal position. The execution of the idea is just as simple: entries are marked by syncTabs. Text can be synchronized to a selected target syncTab by setting the insertion point to the position in the text to be synchronized and choosing the "Sync To Target" menu item or hitting the tab key to bind the position to the target syncTab. This marks the position and all positions previously bound to the syncTab as simultaneous. Necessary adjustments to keep the entries of a sync in horizontal alignment are handled automatically by syncWRITER.
